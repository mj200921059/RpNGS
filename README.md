# RpNGS: an interactive web platform for pathogen report generation using metagenomics data


# Summary
RpNGS is a graphical interface application for clinical metagenomics detection including basic data collection in the microbiology laboratory and sequencing data analysis in the computation lab. Experimenter, bioinformatician and clinician can work together for giving a pathogen detection report based on the clinical infomation and the interpretation of mNGS data, using interactive data tables, alignment coverage viewer and word template.
